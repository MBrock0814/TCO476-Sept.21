**Washing your Dog**

	1. First get the required items: dog shampoo, a dog, a tub, and a towel. Optional: some dog treats. First start the tub and fill with water, depending on the size of dog. Make sure the water is just up to the dog's body and the water is not too hot or too cold. Then, get your dog and put it into the water and make sure your dog's fur is completely wet. Then get the dog shampoo and put it on your dog. Rub the shampoo into your dog's fur and make sure you get every part of your dog to completely clean it. Once you are satisfied, use the water to wash all of the shampoo off. Then once the shampoo is gone you can dry your dog off with the towel and then you are done. Just make sure to get rid of all the water and if you have treats give your dog a treat!
